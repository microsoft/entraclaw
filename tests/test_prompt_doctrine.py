"""String-match guards for canonical prompt doctrine.

These tests pin the doctrine that every host-injected prompt file
(``AGENTS.md``, ``CLAUDE.md``, ``.github/copilot-instructions.md``) and
the body's ``channel-discipline.md`` mention the ``wait_for_sponsor_dm``
tool by name. Per Learning #48, this is the only injection vector that
reliably reaches the LLM in Copilot CLI / Claude Code, so the rule must
live in all three host files plus the canonical anatomy fragment.

The wait-tool's own ``@mcp.tool()`` docstring also has to carry the
operational rule, because tool descriptions ARE injected into the model's
system prompt by both hosts.
