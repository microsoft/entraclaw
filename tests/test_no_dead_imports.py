"""Guard against re-introducing the failed PTY-supervisor / terminal-watcher modules.

Phase 3 of the Copilot-CLI watcher plan deleted ``src/entraclaw/supervise.py`` and
``src/entraclaw/watch.py`` (along with their ``entraclaw-supervise`` / ``entraclaw-watch``
console scripts) once ``wait_for_sponsor_dm`` shipped in PR #46. The wait-tool is the
only sanctioned wake mechanism — any new code that imports the removed modules is a
regression toward the failed approach. This test fails loudly if it happens.

See ``docs/runbooks/hard-won-learnings.md`` Learning #49 for why the long-blocking
MCP tool replaces the PTY supervisor.
