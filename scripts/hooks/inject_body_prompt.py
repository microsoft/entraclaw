"""Claude Code SessionStart hook: inject the body prompt as context.

Why this exists
---------------

``src/entraclaw/mcp_server.py::_load_agent_instructions`` assembles the
body prompt from ``prompts/agent_system.md`` (with ``@include``
expansion over ``prompts/anatomy/*.md``) and hands it to FastMCP as the
server's ``instructions`` string. Claude Code surfaces those MCP-server
instructions in debug UI but **does not** inject them into the LLM
system prompt. The body rules — channel discipline, security posture,
identity/tools — therefore only reach the agent if the agent
deliberately goes and fetches them.

This hook fixes that by reading the same file at SessionStart and
emitting it as ``additionalContext``, which Claude Code injects into
the conversation alongside the CLAUDE.md and system reminders.

Contract (matches Claude Code SessionStart hook spec):
  * Exit 0 always. This is a convenience injector, not an enforcement
    gate — a broken hook must not break sessions.
  * Stdout is either empty (nothing to inject) or one JSON object of
    shape
    ``{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "SessionStart",
    "additionalContext": "..."}}``.
  * ``@include <path>`` directives are expanded one level against the
    parent directory of ``prompts/agent_system.md``. Missing targets
    leave a visible ``<!-- missing @include <path> -->`` placeholder
    rather than crashing.

The ``@include`` logic intentionally mirrors
``mcp_server._expand_includes`` — keep them in sync if either changes.
