# Openclaw Identity Research — Engineering Summary

**Date:** April 10, 2026
**Team:** Brandon Werner
**Status:** Three auth modes working: Agent User (three-hop), Delegated (MSAL), Bot Gateway (M365 Agents SDK). Progressive identity state machine. 299 tests. 6 MCP tools + background channel + bot IPC.

---

## What We're Building

A proof-of-concept demonstrating that **device-local AI agents can have their own identity** in Microsoft Entra, separate from the human user. Three identity modes:

1. **Agent User** (production path) — Blueprint → Agent Identity → Agent User via three-hop flow. Agent sends as its own Entra user.
2. **Delegated** (instant start) — MSAL interactive auth with human's token. Messages prefixed `[EntraClaw]`. No provisioning needed.
3. **Bot Gateway** (new) — M365 Agents SDK bot server with Dev Tunnel. Bot has its own identity in Teams by design. No Agent User provisioning, no M365 license.

**Identity Chain (Agent User):** Blueprint (certificate auth) → Agent Identity (FIC exchange) → Agent User (user_fic grant) → Graph API with `idtyp=user` token

**Channel:** Background poll every 5s (Graph API) or 2s (bot JSONL) → push via `notifications/claude/channel` → Claude Code receives messages automatically

### The Demo Scenario — WORKING (Three Modes)

| Step | Agent User Mode | Delegated Mode | Bot Mode |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Setup | `./scripts/setup.sh` (10-15 min) | `./scripts/setup_delegated.sh` (60s) | `./scripts/start_bot.sh` + Dev Tunnel |
| Auth | Three-hop flow (automatic) | MSAL browser sign-in (cached) | Bot app credentials |
| Identity | Agent's own Entra user | Human's identity + `[EntraClaw]` prefix | Bot's app identity |
| Send | Graph API as Agent User | Graph API as human | Bot Framework relay |
| Receive | Graph API poll (5s) | Graph API poll (5s) | Bot activity handler (instant) |

### MCP Tools (6 total)

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `send_teams_message` | Send message to chat in Teams (text or HTML). Bot mode: writes to outbound JSONL. | ✅ Live |
| `add_teams_member` | Add user to chat (cross-tenant auto-resolved) | ✅ Live |
| `read_teams_messages` | Read human's replies from Teams | ✅ Live |
| `watch_teams_replies` | Poll for new human replies with dedup | ✅ Live |
| `whoami` | Show agent identity and connection status | ✅ Live |
| `audit_log` | Record audit event before actions | ✅ Live |

## Current Milestone: Bidirectional Teams Loop

**Spec:** `docs/architecture/PLAN-multi-tenant-lightweight-chat.md`
**Research:** `docs/platform-learnings/mcp-messaging-servers.md`

### Scope (scoped down from original)

1. **`watch_teams_replies` tool** — blocking polling tool with server-side cursor, timestamp overlap + message ID dedup
2. **Token auto-refresh** — eager (55-min threshold) + lazy (retry on 401) for three-hop flow

**Out of scope (LLM handles natively):** Conversation state tracking, action dispatch.

### Design Decisions Informed by Platform Research

Researched 12+ MCP messaging servers (Slack, iMessage, Discord, Teams). Key findings that changed the design:

- **Every MCP messaging server uses stateless request-response** — no background polling. Our blocking poll tool aligns with ecosystem patterns.
- **Client-side filtering mandatory** — Graph API `$filter`/`$orderby` unreliable for chat messages (Learning #16)
- **Timestamp overlap + seen-set dedup** — proven by imessage-kit (2s overlap, Map dedup). Prevents boundary message loss (Learning #17)
- **Token refresh is universal #1 pain point** — official Slack MCP had 18 re-auths in 5 days. Our three-hop flow is the most complex token lifecycle of any MCP messaging server studied (Learning #18)
- **Delta queries deferred** — too much complexity upfront (`@removed` entries, change types). Start simple (Learning #21)

### Known Unknowns (Will Discover During Testing)

1. **Overlap window size** — 2s borrowed from iMessage/SQLite; Graph API latency may need 3-5s
2. **Three-hop refresh behavior** — nobody else has refreshed a chained OBO flow mid-session
3. **Agent User token + `$orderby`** — floriscornel uses MSAL delegated tokens; our `user_fic` grant may behave differently
4. **Rate limiting thresholds** — undocumented for our endpoint + token type combination

### Solved: The MCP "Close the Loop" Problem

**Problem:** LLM doesn't automatically check for replies after sending a Teams message. The MCP protocol is request-response — no mechanism for the server to wake up the LLM when new data arrives.

**Solution:** Background polling + `notifications/claude/channel` push notifications. The MCP server declares `experimental: {"claude/channel": {}}` capability and pushes inbound Teams messages directly into the Claude Code conversation — the same mechanism used by the iMessage channel plugin.

**Requirements:** Start Claude Code with `--dangerously-load-development-channels server:openclaw` to enable channel notifications for development servers.

**Fallback:** `watch_teams_replies` tool still available for explicit polling. Background poll uses separate dedup state so both can detect the same message independently (Learning #27).

**Research:** See `docs/platform-learnings/mcp-close-the-loop.md` for full analysis of 12+ MCP messaging servers, the MCP Triggers & Events Working Group, and the three problems we solved (capability declaration, startup flag, separate state).

## What Works (Shipped)

- End-to-end: setup.sh → MCP server → Teams message delivery ✅
- Three-hop Agent User token flow (Blueprint → Agent Identity → Agent User)
- Agent User creation via Graph beta API (`microsoft.graph.agentUser`)
- Agent User license assignment (auto-detects Teams-capable SKUs)
- Consent grant (`oAuth2PermissionGrant`) for Teams/Chat permissions
- Dedicated provisioner app (avoids Azure CLI token rejection)
- State persisted in `.entraclaw-state.json` (idempotent, no secret reset)
- MCP server auto-discovered via `.mcp.json`
- `--teams-user` flag to set Teams recipient separately from admin
- Teams read with null-from handling (system messages)
- 27 hard-won learnings documented in runbooks
- Bidirectional Teams channel with background polling + push notifications
- Certificate auth for Blueprint (private key in OS keystore, no secrets on disk, ADR-003)
- Token auto-refresh: eager (55-min) + lazy (401 retry) for all tools
- `notifications/claude/channel` push — same mechanism as iMessage channel plugin
- Message dedup: 2s overlap window + bounded seen-set (imessage-kit pattern)
- 429 rate limit handling propagates through polling tool
- Autonomous agent instructions — acts on Teams messages without terminal prompting
- Multi-user group chat support (setup.sh `--teams-user=user1,user2`)
- Cross-tenant federated chats for B2B guests (auto-detects guest UPN, resolves home tenant via OpenID discovery)
- `add_teams_member` tool — add users to chat at runtime without restart (auto-resolves tenant from email domain)
- Chat ID persistence across restarts — no duplicate group chats
- 429 rate limit handling with Retry-After propagation
- All code passes ruff lint + format
- **Progressive identity state machine** — UNAUTHENTICATED → DELEGATED → PROVISIONING → AGENT_USER with asyncio.Lock-protected transitions
- **MSAL delegated auth** — localhost redirect + device code fallback, OS-encrypted token cache via msal-extensions
- **Setup script** for delegated mode (`scripts/setup_delegated.sh`) — sign in once, cache token, launch MCP server
- **Bot Gateway** — M365 Agents SDK bot server + JSONL IPC (inbound/outbound with fcntl.flock) + Dev Tunnel manager + conversation reference persistence. Coexists via `ENTRACLAW_MODE=bot` config switch
- **Identity-aware user ID** — `_effective_user_id()` returns the correct user ID for the current mode (agent user OID vs signed-in human OID)

### What's Not Started
- Azure Bot resource registration on werner.ac (needed for live bot test)
- Adaptive Cards for bot mode (Phase 2)
- Windows VM provisioning and testing

| 12 | teardown.sh silent exit on missing .env | Silent | Guard with `[ -f .env ]` check |
| 13 | stderr swallowed throughout scripts | Hidden errors | Removed all `2>/dev/null` |
| 14 | Admin and Teams user conflated | Wrong recipient | Added `--teams-user` flag |
