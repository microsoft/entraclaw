# Entraclaw Identity Research

**Source:** <https://github.com/microsoft/entraclaw> · **License:** MIT

Entraclaw is a Python MCP server that gives a device-local agent its own Entra **Agent ID** and an **Agent User** that has all the capabilities of a human user in a Microsoft tenant. It can have a Teams presence and be invited to meetings to chat with your colleagues 1:1, a mailbox it can monitor and respond to, create and edit Word documents, make PowerPoint presentations, and allows you to access your CLI. The agent signs in autonomously, sends Teams messages from its own account, and writes audit events against its own object ID. It runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows, and works with Claude Code, Copilot CLI, or any MCP-speaking client.

**All you need to get started is:**

- A Free Microsoft 365 Developer tenant (sign up at <https://aka.ms/m365devprogram>)
- A license that includes Teams and Outlook (E3 or E5 dev tenant licenses work)
- Python 3.12 installed locally

The scripts take care of the rest: provisioning the Agent Identity Blueprint, Agent Identity, and Agent User in Entra; uploading a self-signed certificate; assigning the license; and configuring the local MCP server.

**Microsoft Entra Agent ID** and **Microsoft Agent 365** — which enable these experiences — went GA on 2026-05-01. Entraclaw is the reference implementation that pulls those primitives together on a real device, today.

## Open Research Questions

- What M365 license tier is optimal for Agent Users? (E3 vs E5 vs Teams Enterprise)
- How do you track agent actions across OSes with a universal audit store?
- Conditional Access for Agent Identities — how does device-local enforcement work without a Layer 4 anchor?
- Will Entra add a `registration_endpoint` (RFC 7591) so MCP servers can stop maintaining a two-app-registration workaround? Tracked in `docs/platform-learnings/agent-id-blueprints-and-users.md`.
- What's the right ceiling on per-tenant Agent User count before directory-quota pressure forces a federation model?
