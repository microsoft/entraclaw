# Openclaw Identity Research

Openclaw brings cloud-style identity tracking to device-local agents. When an autonomous agent runs on your Mac, Linux, or Windows machine, it gets its own **Agent ID** and **Agent User** in Microsoft Entra — so audit logs always distinguish agent actions from human actions.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agent Identity** | A service principal representing a specific agent instance, parented by a Blueprint |
| **Agent User** | A purpose-built Entra user account (1:1 with an Agent Identity) that can have a mailbox, Teams presence, and M365 license |
| **Three-Hop Flow** | Blueprint token → Agent Identity token (FIC) → Agent User token (`user_fic` grant) — fully autonomous, no human in the loop |
| **Platform Abstraction** | OS-specific credential storage (Keychain, Credential Manager, Secret Service) |
| **Digital Worker** | The agent as a first-class team member — mailbox, Teams, org chart, @mentionable |

## Open Research Questions

- What M365 license tier is optimal for Agent Users? (E3 vs E5 vs Teams Enterprise)
- How do you track agent actions across OSes with a universal audit store?
- Conditional Access for Agent Identities — how does Layer 4 enforcement work device-locally?
