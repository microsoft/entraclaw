# Mind-Body Nervous-System Phase 3 Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (recommended) or `superpowers:executing-plans` to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Design and build a reusable runtime layer that composes a body MCP server and persona-sati into one coherent agent surface, so host LLMs no longer have to manually coordinate body and mind from prompt instructions alone.

**Architecture:** Phase 3 introduces a "nervous system" broker that sits between the host LLM and the separate body/mind MCP servers. The broker does not collapse body and mind; it makes their coordination explicit by owning session bootstrap, tool-call observation, degraded-mode state, and safety gates. The first deliverable should be a design document and proof-of-concept wrapper, not a full replacement for entraclaw or persona-sati.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12, MCP client/server SDK, FastMCP, pytest, ruff, JSON-RPC proxying, persona-sati `bootstrap_session()`, entraclaw body tools.

---

## Why Phase 3 exists

Phase 1+2 reduce the host LLM burden: host-visible instructions tell the model to call `bootstrap_session()`, and persona-sati returns one compact operating packet. That is better, but it is still prompt-mediated.

The long-term problem is structural: MCP exposes tools, but it does not guarantee that the model runs a startup protocol, uses semantic memory tools at the right time, or keeps body/mind routing straight. A nervous-system runtime makes these behaviors part of the execution path rather than relying entirely on the LLM's memory of instructions.

## Boundary decisions

- Keep persona-sati body-agnostic. It must not learn Teams, email, or entraclaw-specific state.
- Keep entraclaw body-first. It owns Teams/email/tools/security/audit.
- The broker may know how to connect body and mind, but it should avoid embedding persona content or body business logic.
- Start with read-only proxy and bootstrap enforcement before adding write or high-blast-radius gating.
- Treat this as a new runtime layer, not a patch inside either existing repo until the design proves itself.

## Proposed repo placement

There are two viable placements:

1. **New package inside entraclaw:** `src/entraclaw/runtime/`
   - Faster because entraclaw already owns body tools and efferent-copy.
   - Risk: makes the broker look entraclaw-specific.
2. **New independent repo/package:** `agent-nervous-system`
   - Cleaner product boundary.
   - More setup work.

Recommendation for the proof of concept: create a small `src/entraclaw/runtime/` prototype first, then extract once the interface is stable.

## File map for proof of concept

### Entraclaw repo: `/Volumes/Development HD/entraclaw-identity-research`

- Create: `docs/architecture/DESIGN-mind-body-nervous-system.md` — final architecture before code.
- Create: `src/entraclaw/runtime/__init__.py` — package marker.
- Create: `src/entraclaw/runtime/broker.py` — broker data model and routing policy.
- Create: `src/entraclaw/runtime/mcp_client.py` — thin MCP client abstraction for body/mind upstreams.
- Create: `src/entraclaw/runtime/server.py` — FastMCP wrapper server proof of concept.
- Create: `tests/runtime/test_broker.py` — pure routing/bootstrap tests.
- Create: `tests/runtime/test_runtime_server.py` — in-process wrapper tests.
- Modify: `.mcp.json.example` — optional broker entry once the proof of concept works.
- Modify: `docs/TODO-persona-sati-host-bootstrap.md` — link to the Phase 3 design after Task 1 creates it.

---

## Phase 3A: Design the runtime contract

### Task 1: Write the architecture design

**Files:**
- Create: `/Volumes/Development HD/entraclaw-identity-research/docs/architecture/DESIGN-mind-body-nervous-system.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the design document**

Create `docs/architecture/DESIGN-mind-body-nervous-system.md` with these sections:

```markdown
# Design: Mind-Body Nervous-System Runtime

## Problem

Host LLMs can connect to body and mind MCP servers but are not reliable
at running the coordination protocol from prompts alone. MCP
`instructions=` is not reliable model context in Claude Code or Copilot
CLI, and host instruction files do not travel automatically to every
customer repo.

## Goal

Expose one coherent runtime MCP surface that composes a body MCP server
and persona-sati while preserving their separation.

## Non-goals

- Do not merge persona-sati into entraclaw.
- Do not make persona-sati know Teams, Slack, email, or body-specific
  state.
- Do not load full memory into every prompt.
- Do not proxy high-blast-radius tools until bootstrap and degraded-mode
  enforcement are working.

## Runtime responsibilities

1. Call persona-sati `bootstrap_session()` at host session start or
   before the first proxied external action.
2. Cache the bootstrap packet for the session.
3. Expose a `runtime_status()` tool showing bootstrap state,
   degraded-mode state, connected upstreams, and last cognition event.
4. Proxy body tools after bootstrap.
5. Fire `observe()` before and after proxied body tools when the body
   has not already done so.
6. Provide a `reflect_user_message()` helper for host-visible user
   statements when the host cannot enforce `reflect()` itself.

## Trust boundaries

The body remains authoritative for security, audit, channel discipline,
and external state. The mind remains authoritative for voice, memory,
continuity, and cognition. The runtime is a coordinator; it should not
invent persona content or override body authorization gates.

## Degraded modes

| State | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|
| Mind unavailable | Allow body read-only tools; block or warn on external writes depending on tool classification. |
| Body unavailable | Expose mind tools and status only. |
| Bootstrap missing | Run bootstrap before first proxied tool. |
| Observe unavailable | Continue with explicit degraded cognition flag in `runtime_status()`. |
| Host prompt missing | Rely on runtime tool descriptions and result-required next actions. |

## Proof-of-concept scope

The POC proxies a small allowlist: `whoami`, `read_teams_messages`, and
`send_teams_message`. It proves bootstrap enforcement, status reporting,
and observe wrapping without attempting full MCP dynamic proxying.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Review design against Phase 1+2**

Confirm the design assumes persona-sati has `bootstrap_session()`. If Phase 2 has not landed, stop Phase 3 implementation and finish Phase 2 first.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit the design before code**

Run:

```bash
cd "/Volumes/Development HD/entraclaw-identity-research"
git add docs/architecture/DESIGN-mind-body-nervous-system.md
git commit -m "docs: design mind-body nervous-system runtime" \
  -m "Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

Run:

```bash
cd "/Volumes/Development HD/entraclaw-identity-research"
mkdir -p tests/runtime
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write failing broker tests**

Create `tests/runtime/test_broker.py` with:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

def test_broker_starts_unbootstrapped() -> None:
    state = BrokerState()

    assert state.bootstrapped is False

    state = BrokerState()
    packet = {
        "schema_version": 1,
        "required_first_call": "bootstrap_session",
        "degraded_mode": {"persona_available": True, "reasons": []},
    }

    state.record_bootstrap(packet)

    assert state.bootstrapped is True
    assert state.bootstrap_packet == packet
    assert state.degraded_reasons == []

        "degraded_mode": {
            "persona_available": False,
            "reasons": ["system prompt unavailable"],
        },
    }

    state.record_bootstrap(packet)

    assert state.bootstrapped is True
    assert state.degraded_reasons == ["system prompt unavailable"]


def test_tool_classification_marks_human_visible_writes() -> None:
    assert ToolClassification.for_tool("send_teams_message").human_visible_write is True
    assert ToolClassification.for_tool("send_email").human_visible_write is True
    assert ToolClassification.for_tool("read_teams_messages").human_visible_write is False
    assert ToolClassification.for_tool("whoami").human_visible_write is False
```

## Promotion criteria before making the broker real

Do not replace the current dual-MCP setup until all of these are true:

- `bootstrap_session()` is shipped in persona-sati and works from both SSE and stdio-shim transports.
- The broker can connect to real upstream MCP servers, not just fake in-process test doubles.
- The broker can list and proxy at least the safe read-only body tools.
- Human-visible write tools have explicit gating policy and tests.
- Degraded-mode behavior is visible through `runtime_status()`.
- Manual smoke test proves a host can use only the broker MCP entry and still send a Teams message with persona-sati observation.

## Expected Phase 3 outcome

Phase 3 should end with a reviewed design and a small proof of concept, not a mandatory migration. The current production path remains:

1. Host connects to entraclaw body.
2. Host connects to persona-sati mind.
3. Host calls `bootstrap_session()` first.
4. Efferent-copy and tool docstrings cover the critical action boundaries.

The broker becomes the next runtime candidate after it proves that it reduces prompt burden without weakening the body/mind separation.
