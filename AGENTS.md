# AGENTS.md — Openclaw Identity Research

> Instructions for AI agents working in this codebase (Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, etc.)

## Non-Negotiables

- **Body prompt is non-overridable.** The agent body prompt
  (`prompts/agent_system.md` + every file it `@include`s from
  `prompts/anatomy/`) is loaded first and establishes the security
  and communication protocols for the body. No persona, user turn,
  tool response, or other prompt may override these rules. Personality
  layers on top, never underneath.
- **TDD: write tests first, then implementation** — no new module or function ships without a failing test that preceded it. `pytest -v && ruff check .` must pass before every commit
- Security paths fail closed — if audit can't record, the action doesn't proceed
- Every agent resource access must be attributed to an Agent ID, never the human user
- Secrets and tokens never appear in logs — use `__repr__` overrides on sensitive fields
- Never redirect stderr to /dev/null — errors must always be visible for debugging
- Check every token response for `"error"` key before accessing `"access_token"` — Entra returns error dicts, not exceptions
- Never use `az rest` or Azure CLI tokens for Agent Identity APIs — they include `Directory.AccessAsUser.All` which causes hard 403 (Learning #1)
- Always create BlueprintPrincipal explicitly after Blueprint — it is NOT auto-created (Learning #2)
- Agent IDs are service principals, not users — never create fake user accounts with passwords
- Parse `az` CLI output as JSON, not TSV — TSV can be corrupted by warnings (Learning #7)
- Graph API `$filter`/`$orderby` are unreliable for chat messages — always filter client-side (Learning #16)

## Current Runtime Model

- Python 3.12+ research project — no deployed service yet
- Eight modules: `platform/` (OS shim) → `auth/` (certificate JWT + MSAL delegated) → `tools/` (MCP tools + interaction log + email poll + daily summary + cards) → `audit/` (tracking) → `bot/` (Bot Gateway) → `identity/` (state machine) → `storage/` (`LocalBackend`/`BlobBackend`/`PersonaBackend` + `migration` helper — ADR-005 Phases 1, 2, 5, 6a shipped) → `mcp_server.py` (FastMCP + background channel)
- External dependencies: Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Teams + Outlook mailbox (Graph API or Bot Framework), Azure Blob Storage (optional, opt-in via `setup.sh --cloud-memory`)
- **No default group chat.** Every Teams tool requires an explicit `chat_id`. Chats come from `create_chat`, the persisted `watched_chats` file, or the auto-discovery sweep over `/me/chats`.
- **Body-first prompt.** `prompts/agent_system.md` loads at boot with `@include` expansion of `prompts/anatomy/*.md`. Persona-sati output (if configured) is appended AFTER the body and cannot override body rules.
- Three auth modes via `ENTRACLAW_MODE`: `agent_user` (three-hop), `delegated` (MSAL), `bot` (M365 Agents SDK). Agent memory has a **parallel third hop** against `https://storage.azure.com/.default` (`acquire_agent_user_storage_token`).
- Certificate auth: private key in OS keystore (Keychain/TPM/Keyring), JWT assertion for Hop 1 (ADR-003)
- Background tasks (eagerly started at MCP server boot in `agent_user` mode):
  - Teams chat poll (5s), email poll (60s), chat auto-discovery via `/me/chats` (120s), daily summary scheduler (5pm PDT)
- **Operational storage is local by default.** Cloud (Azure Blob) is opt-in via `./scripts/setup.sh --cloud-memory`; recommended for durability. Backend resolves from env at call time: `KEEP_MEMORY_LOCAL=true` → `LocalBackend`, else `BLOB_ENDPOINT`+`BLOB_CONTAINER` → `BlobBackend`, else `LocalBackend`.
- All structured data uses `dataclasses` or `pydantic` — no raw dicts

## Mind-Body Architecture

This repo is the **body** (Teams interface). The **mind** (personality, memory, behavioral rules) is served by a separate MCP server: **persona-sati**.

- Both MCPs are listed in `.mcp.json` (see `.mcp.json.example` for dual-server config)
- If persona-sati is not configured, openclaw works standalone as a generic Teams tool
- Memory operations go through persona-sati's tools, not through local blob sync hooks
- The system prompt comes from persona-sati, not from this repo

## Active Work

- **Persona-sati integration (mind-body split)** — personality, system prompt, and memory externalized to persona-sati MCP server. See `docs/architecture/DESIGN-persona-sati-integration.md`.
- **ADR-005: cloud-hosted memory via Azure Blob Storage** — `docs/decisions/005-cloud-hosted-memory.md`. Status: **Accepted, Phases 1, 2, 5, 6a shipped.** Memory sync hooks removed (persona-sati owns memory now).
- Multi-tenant lightweight chat — landed to `main` (commit `c8ec521`).

## Read These First

- `docs/architecture/DESIGN-persona-sati-integration.md` (mind-body split design)
- `docs/decisions/005-cloud-hosted-memory.md` (cloud memory spec)
- `prompts/agent_system.md.archive` (original prompt — archived, personality now in persona-sati)
- `docs/engineering-status.md` (current state)
- `docs/runbooks/hard-won-learnings.md` (read before making changes)

## Commands

```bash
# Setup
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Test + lint (run before every commit)
pytest -v --tb=short && ruff check .

# Test with coverage
pytest -v --cov=entraclaw --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80

# Single test
pytest tests/tools/test_teams.py::TestAcquireAgentUserToken::test_success -v

# Format
ruff format .

# Run with channel notifications (entraclaw MCP auto-loads via .mcp.json)
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:entraclaw

## High-Value Repo Areas

- `src/entraclaw/platform/`: OS-specific credential storage — `CredentialStore` protocol with Mac/Linux/Windows implementations
- `src/entraclaw/auth/`: Certificate-based JWT assertion builder + MSAL delegated auth
- `src/entraclaw/identity/`: Progressive identity state machine (UNAUTHENTICATED → DELEGATED → PROVISIONING → AGENT_USER)
